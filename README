This is a modified version of strace, a system call tracer for Linux.
It can launch a filter executable (see filter.pl for an example) to check
whether a (completed) syscall should have been made. If not, the filter can
decide to kill the program in question. See at bottom for rationale.

strace is released under a Berkeley-style license at the request
of Paul Kranenburg; see the file COPYING for details.

See the file CREDITS for a list of authors and other contributors.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

See the file NEWS for information on what has changed in recent
versions.

You can get the latest version of strace from its homepage at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace/ .

Please send bug reports and enhancements to the strace
mailinglist at strace-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.


Why on earth would you want to use this? Certainly you can get better
system isolation with SELinux and/or Xen? Yes. However, the typical
isolation solution will not present you with a popup dialog if your
software decides to attempt something "interesting". Also, it is ok
for your browser to enumerate your home directory, _iff_ you just
opened the save as dialog pointing to that directory. Again, the
typical isolation solution will not handle this case.
